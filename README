Hello world!
How are you?

I am making a second change to this file.
I am going to explain what I have learn thus far:

Create a repository after downloading and making username:
Follow directions from website (easy step)
Make sure to have SSH key added
Dont forget your passphrase!!

Common commands:
cd --change directory to which you want to work with.
notepad README --open file named 'README' in notepad to make changes
	**need to find out how to open other editors 

git add README --adds changes made which are in red to file README and will be green to show
	changes have been made

git add commit -m "first commit" --tracks changes under given message "first commit" as to understand
	why certain changes were made or different stages of progress(essentially a label for commit)

git push origin master --pushes the changes made to the repository from local computer to github site


git status --shows the status of any changes you've made in repository to file
	in red --files that have not been committed(saved)
	in green --files that have been saved and recognized

git log --gives history of work done by author and date of work done
	keeps track of users for large project

git reflog --basically same as git log but no author or date

git show --shows lasts updates

git k --GUI interface to track changes of files


flags:
-m --message
-h --shows options(used with git show or git log)
